'''Defines the SimpleXmlHandlerBase class to convert simple XML to DataObject
'''

from lxml import etree

from solaris_install.data_object import DataObject, ParsingError


class SimpleXmlHandlerBase(DataObject):
    '''Simple XML handling DataObject base-class.

       Not to be instantiated directly, should be sub-classed.

       Converts a simple xml tag (e.g. <tag>) to a DataObject, if there is a
       name attribute in the tag, then it will be used as the name of the
       DataObject.

       To make it work, you need to sub-class it and redefine the value of
       TAG_NAME to match the XML tag, e.g.:

            from solaris_install.data_object.simple import SimpleXmlHandlerBase

            # Define the class
            class MyTag(SimpleXmlHandlerBase):
                TAG_NAME="mytag"

            # Register with DOC so that it will be used.
            DataObjectCache.register_class(MyTag)

       and that's it, this will take an XML tag like the following:

           <mytag>
              ...
           </mytag>

       and generate a DataObject for storage in the Data Object Cache.

       The main reason you might do this is to place a set of sub-tags into a
       specific location in the DOC.

    TAG_NAME = None

    def __init__(self, name=None):
        if self.TAG_NAME is None:
            raise ValueError("TAG_NAME should not be None.")

        super(DataObject, self).__init__(name)

    def to_xml(self):
        '''Generate XML'''
        elem = etree.Element(self.TAG_NAME)
        if self.name and self.name != self.TAG_NAME:
            # We got a name on import, so set it on export
            elem.set("name", self.name)

        return(elem)

    @classmethod
    def can_handle(cls, element):
        '''Check if XML tag matches TAG_NAME'''

            return False
        return True

           If there is a name attribute in the XML tag, then we will use that
