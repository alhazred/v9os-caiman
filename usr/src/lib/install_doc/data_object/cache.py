    Usually accessed by the Engine singleton, but may be used independently

    Provides the following functionality:

    - Has two sub-trees:

      - persistent - will be written to disk if snapshot mechanism is used,
                     and is overwritten if snapshots are loaded.
      - volatile   - exists only in-memory and is not effected by snapshot
                     loading or written when a snapshot is taken.

    - Snapshot and Roll-back

      - It is possible to write out data from the 'persistent' sub-tree to a
        file or file-like object.

      - It is possible to roll-back the 'persistent' sub-tree to the contents
        of a provided file or file-like object.

    - XML Manifest Import and Generation

      - Drives the import of an XML manifest into a DataObject based tree
      - Drives the generation of XML suitable for conversion in to an XML
        manifest via XSLT.

    Sub-classes DataObjectBase to ensure that its not possible to
    add or remove the "persistent" and "volatile" children.

    Consumsers of the Data Object Cache should not insert/delete children
    to/from the DataObjectCache object, but instead should insert/delete
    them to/from the 'persistent' or 'volatile' sub-trees.
