''' AI SCF Library and Object Types

This module implements an SMF to Python bridge primarily for AutoInstall
components

Example usages:
---------------------
To load the module, one runs
import libaiscf

Then to create an SMF instance object, one can run
(for svc:/system/install/server:default)
instance=libaiscf.AISCF()
(for svc:/system/install/server:someThingElse)
instance=libaiscf.AISCF(instance="someThingElse")

To view an instance's state (online, offline, maintenance, etc.) one can query
the state property. For example:
> > > libaiscf.AISCF().state
'online'

One can change the state too. Supported states are:
CLEAR, DEGRADE, DISABLE, ENABLE, MAINTENANCE, RESTART, RESTORE, REFRESH
For example:
> > > libaiscf.AISCF().state="DISABLE"
[wait a bit (~5 sec), or it'll still be transitioning]
> > > libaiscf.AISCF().state
'offline'

Further, to create an AI service object, one runs:
(For clarification, this is just an SMF property group representation)

service=libaiscf.AIservice(instance,"serviceName")

To see a property key under the service, one can do:
service['boot-dir'] (which returns the string value or a KeyError as a
                     dictionary would if the key doesn't exist)
To set or change a property under the service, one can do:
service['boot-dir']="/var/ai/service1_image"

All actions query SMF and no data is cached in case something changes under
the consumer. All actions are handed to SMF when executed.
