class ManifestWriter(AbstractCheckpoint):
    '''
        ManifestWriter - export, transform and validate an XML manifest.


        Summary:
        This class implements the AbstractCheckpoint abstract base class
        which allows it to be executed from within the InstallEngine.
        It also provides an additional API that allow it to be run
        outside of the InstallEngine context.


        Initializer method:
        The parameters of the initializer method give the location
        of the XML manifest to be created and define what transformation
        and validation will be performed.


        execute() and parse() methods:
        When running in an InstallEngine context the execute() method
        performs the main tasks of exporting and, optionally, transforming
        and validating the manifest.

        When run outside the InstallEngine context, the write() method
        performs these same functions.

        The main difference between execute() and write() is from where
        the DataObjectCache (DOC) reference is obtained.  execute()
        assumes an InstallEngine singleton exists and gets the DOC
        reference from it.  With write(), a reference to an existing DOC
        instance must be passed in.

        If an error occurs during the execute() or write() methods,
        including XML syntax errors or failure to validate the
        manifest, a ManifestError exception is raised.

        If no errors occur, the methods simply return, with no return
        value.  The output manifest file will be created as requested.


        Other public methods:
        The get_progress_estimate() method is required by the parent
        AbstractCheckpoint class.

        The cancel() method defined in AbstractCheckpoint is not
        overridden in ManifestParser.

        validate_from_docinfo=False, dtd_file=None):
        '''
            Class initializer method.

            Parameters:
            - name arg is required by AbstractCheckpoint. Not used.
            - manifest must be the path to a writable XML file
            - xslt_file defaults to None.  Otherwise, it must be the
              path to a readable XSLT file which will be applied to
              the manifest XML data to transform it into the required
              format.  Typically, this is used to structure the data
              according to the AI or DC schema.
            - validate_from_docinfo defaults to False.  It is only
              relevant if, following XSL Transformation, the XML document
              contains a reference to a DTD.  This will typically have
              been added by the XSLT file.  If validate_from_docinfo is
              True, the XML document will be validated against its
              referenced DTD, if present.  If validation fails, an
              error is raised.  If validate_from_docinfo is False or
              no DTD is referenced, this validation is skipped.
            - dtd_file defaults to None.  Otherwise, it must be the
              path to a DTD file against which the manifest XML will be
              validated before it is written out.  If validation is
              attempted and fails, an error is raised.  This validation
              is separate from that controlled by validate_from_docinfo.

            Returns:
            - Nothing

            Raises:
            - ManifestError is raised if invalid values are specified
              for any paramaters or if xslt_file or dtd_file are specified
              but do not exist.
