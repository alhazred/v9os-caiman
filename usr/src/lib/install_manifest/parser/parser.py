class ManifestParser(AbstractCheckpoint):
    '''
        ManifestParser - parse, validate and import an XML manifest.

        Summary:
        This class implements the AbstractCheckpoint abstract base class
        which allows it to be executed from within the InstallEngine.
        It also provides an additional API that allow it to be run
        outside of the InstallEngine context.


        Initializer method:
        The parameters of the initializer method give the location
        of the XML manifest to be parsed and define what validation and
        other optional operations will be performed.


        execute() and parse() methods:
        When running in an InstallEngine context the execute() method
        performs the main tasks of parsing and, optionally, validating
        the manifest.

        When run outside the InstallEngine context, the parse() method
        performs these same functions.

        The main difference between execute() and parse() is whether or
        not the manifest data is imported into a DataObjectCache (DOC)
        instance and from where the reference to the DOC is obtained.
        execute() assumes an InstallEngine singleton exists and gets
        the DOC reference from it.  With parse(), importing to the DOC
        is optional and if required, a reference to an existing DOC
        instance must be passed in.

        If an error occurs during the execute() or parse() methods,
        including XML syntax errors or failure to validate the
        manifest, a ManifestError exception is raised.

        If no errors occur, the methods simply return, with no return
        value.  If importing to a DOC has been requested, the data
        will be available in the DOC for retrieval by other system
        components.


        Other public methods:
        The get_progress_estimate() method is required by the parent
        AbstractCheckpoint class.

        The cancel() method defined in AbstractCheckpoint is not
        overridden in ManifestParser.

    def __init__(self, name, manifest=None, validate_from_docinfo=None,
        dtd_file=None, load_defaults=True, call_xinclude=False):
        '''
            Class initializer method.

            Parameters:
            - name arg is required by AbstractCheckpoint.  Not used.
            - manifest, if passed,  must be the path to a readable XML file.
              The manifest value can be set when the object is instantiated
              by passing in a value for this param, or setting can be deferred
              until later by not passing in any value here. In this case,
              before the 1st attempt to access the manifest, there must
              be a valid manifest value stored in the DataObjectCache at the
              location specified by MANIFEST_PARSER_DATA.
            - validate_from_docinfo controls whether the manifest is
              validated against the DTD in the file's XML headers, if any.
              The default value is None.  This parameter can have 3 values:
              None: validate against the DTD, if present; if DTD URI is not
                present, no error is raised
              True: attempt to validate against the DTD on-the-fly as it is
                loaded.  If DTD is not specified, raise an error
              False: whether or not a DTD is specified, do not attempt to
                validate against it
              If validation is attempted and fails, an error is raised.
            - dtd_file specifes the path to a DTD against which the manifest
              will be validated.  This validation may be performed instead
              of, or as well as, the validation controlled by
              validate_from_docinfo, or it may be skipped by leaving dtd_file
              as None (the default).  If validation is attempted and fails,
              an error is raised.
              Note: default attribute values (see below) cannot be loaded
              during this form of validation - they can only be loaded if
              the manifest directly references a DTD in its headers.
            - load_defaults must be either True or False.  The default value
              is True.  load_defaults is only relevant when the manifest
              references a DTD.  If True, default attribute values from the
              DTD are loaded when the manifest is parsed.  If the manifest
              does not reference a DTD, no defaults are loaded and no error
              is raised.  (Note: Defaults can be loaded even if
              validate_from_docinfo is False.)
            - call_xinclude must be either True or False and controls
              whether XInclude statements in the manifest will be processed
              or not.  It defaults to False
              Note: Currently, the on-the-fly validation performed if
              validate_from_docinfo=True occurs *before* XInclude statements
              are processed and validation triggered when
              validate_from_docinfo=None or when dtd_file is specified occurs
              *after* XInclude processing.  XInclude processing may affect
              whether validation succeeds or not, so this ordering may need
              to be considered.

            Returns:
            - Nothing

            Raises:
            - ManifestError is raised if invalid values are specified
              for any paramaters or if manifest and/or dtd_file are
              specified but are not actual files
