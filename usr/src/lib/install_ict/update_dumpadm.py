            The AbstractCheckpoint class requires this method
            in sub-classes.

            Updates the dumpadm.conf file to customize it according
            to the install parameters.  (This is just temporary solution,
            as dumpadm(1M) -r option does not work. This issue is tracked
            by Bugster CR 6835106. Once this bug is fixed,dumpadm(1M) -r
            should be used for manipulating /etc/dumpadm.conf instead.)

            Parameters:
            - the dry_run keyword paramater. The default value is False.
              If set to True, the log message provides the steps that would be
              run for the checkpoint.

            Returns:
            - Nothing
              On failure, errors raised are managed by the engine.
