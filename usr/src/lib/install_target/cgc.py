"""
cgc module for "ctypes garbage collection" with finalization.

This module provides CTypesStructureRef, a class whose sole purpose is
cleaning up after a ctypes.Structure (or ctypes.POINTER to ctypes.Structure)
is reaped by the Python garbage collector (or due to reference count).

__del__ is not safe and introduces its own problems so use this instead.

Basic use is to simply create a CTypesStructureRef. For example:

    >>> import ctypes as C
    >>> from pysol.cgc import CTypesStructureRef
    >>> def fin(o): print "done!"
    ...
    >>> class Foo(C.Structure): pass # opaque
    ...
    >>> f = Foo()
    >>> CTypesStructureRef(f, fin)
    <weakref at 81033ec; to 'Foo' at 80fb6ec>
    >>> del f
    done!

This only works for ctypes objects.
This will call your finalizer with an equivalent object (it points to
the same memory) but not the exact Python object.
"""

import ctypes as C
import weakref

# __del__ in Python leads to the garbage collector not being able
#         to collect cycles. That's bad.
#
# weak references on the other hand don't upset the GC.
# And weakrefs can be given a function to call when the *referenced*
# object has been collected by GC.
#
# So the trick is to put weakrefs onto a dictionary (so they do not
# get GC-ed themselves) which have information to recreate the
# original ctypes object and give it to a finalizer (which can free
# memory for example).
#
# With ctypes we just use addressof() on the Structure or POINTER
# object. This address along with type information allow us to
# recreate the object using the "from_address" method of Structure.
#
# Note that from_address() calls __new__() and not __init__() on
# the class.
