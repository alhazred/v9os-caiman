Python packge with ctypes wrapper for libdiskmgt.so (undocumented).

TODO write a blurb about this.

This is how everything is related in libdiskmgt.so:

                               DMAlias        +--- DMPartition
  +---+                           |           |      |
  |   |                           |           |      |
  | DMBus --- DMController --- DMDrive --- DMMedia   |
  |   |            |              |           |      |
  +---+            |              |           |      |
                   +--- DMPath ---+           +--- DMSlice

This means if you have a DMBus object, you can use its
get_associated_descriptors() method to get to the DMController.

All DM* types are subclasses of DMDescriptor class.

All DM* types have attributes and stats property which return
objects derived from solaris_install.target.libnvpair.NVList
(NVList is dictionary like).
