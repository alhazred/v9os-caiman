"""Python package with ctypes wrapper for libnvpair(3LIB).

An nvlist_t is often returned from other C libraries.
This package, and module nvl in particular, provide access to nvlist_t.

nvl.NVList is a collections.MutableMapping and acts, as much as it
can, like a dictionary.

Of course all the C getter/setter functions are available too.
But for more Python code you should set up keys and access an NVList
like a dictionary. If you make the keys global you have only one place
to change the Python code if the C code changes from a C int16_t to
a int32_t. If you used add_*() and lookup_*() routines you will have
to search through all of your code.

If you are implementing another C library, you may need to add the NVList
you return to the special Garbage Collection References. This is done
with cgc.CTypesStructureRef class.

For example:

    from solaris_install.target.cgc import CTypesStructureRef
    from solaris_install.target.libnvpair.nvl import NVList
    # you need just one function to clean up an nvlist:
    from solaris_install.target.libnvpair.cfunc import nvlist_free
    import ctypes as C
    import sys

    if sys.maxint == 2147483647:
        _MYLIB = C.CDLL("/usr/lib/libmylib.so", use_errno=True)
    else:
        _MYLIB = C.CDLL("/usr/lib/64/libmylib.so", use_errno=True)

    def myfinalizer(nvlist):
        print "death to this NVList!"
        print nvlist
        nvlist_free(nvlist)

    _MYLIB.foo.restype = C.c_int
    _MYLIB.foo.argtypes = (C.POINTER(nvl.NVList),)
    def foo():
        nvlist = nvl.NVList__new__() # very important you use __new__()
        err = _MYLIB.foo(C.byref(nvlist))
        CTypesStructureRef(nvlist) # now memory will be garbage collected.
        return nvlist

Users of foo() no longer need to worry about the resources allocated by
foo(), the Python GC will now take care of it.
