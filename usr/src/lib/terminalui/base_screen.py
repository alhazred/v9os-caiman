    in the tuple is the full path to a text file containing help information,

    file is loaded. To support alternate languages, the path name should
    contain a single '%s', which will get replaced with the current language,

    ("/path/to/file/%s/filename.txt", _("File Title"))
    
    HELP_FORMAT: The help title (second item in the HELP_DATA tuple) can
    be indented by replacing the default with "\t%s" (or multiple tabs).
