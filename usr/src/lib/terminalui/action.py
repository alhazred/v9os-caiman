    '''An Action represents the combination of F# key, descriptive text,
    and, in some cases, an associated arbitrary function.

        Constructor

        key (required): An integer corresponding to a function key.
        When the function key is pressed and handled by a MainWindow,
        do_action will be invoked with the current screen as its sole
        parameter.

        For example, key=curses.KEY_F2 would imply this action is
        associated with F2 (and Esc-2)

        text (required): A string description of the action. This is displayed
        in the footer. Keep it short - only 80 characters are available for all
        actions, and it must be assumed that the 'long notation' of
        ESC-#_<description> is printed for each action.

        do_action (optional): If supplied, this parameter should be a
        function that accepts a single parameter. The function will be
        passed the current screen as the parameter, and should return the
        next screen to be shown. If not supplied, the corresponding F# key
        MUST be caught in a subwindow.

        self.key = key

            self.do_action = do_action
        else:
            self.do_action = self._do_action
